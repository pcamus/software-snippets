# Using Bluetooth with Pico.

This [first example](BLE_LED.py) of using bluetooth low energy is based on an example from the site [Electrocredible](https://electrocredible.com/raspberry-pi-pico-w-bluetooth-ble-micropython/).

The Bluetooth modules come from the [MicroPython project github](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/examples/bluetooth)

The Android application used to control the Pico is the Serial Bluetooth Terminal.
